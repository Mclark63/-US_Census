# Brief Overview

The United States is one of the most sought after countries to live in on Earth. Home of the free! In this project, an analysis of the population in major cities vs the sex is analyzed to help people figure out which city they want to live. 

By analyzing the census data, we can categorize each city based on gender ratio and age. The ratio between men and women can help singles make a decision on where they want to settle down. Of course it all depends what your preferences is and what you're truly looking for in your next city.
